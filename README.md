# Bayesian-statistic-assignements

This repository contains my solutions for the assignments from the Bayesian Statistic course I took at the University of Trento. The course covered the foundational concepts of Bayesian statistics, with a particular focus on computational techniques like accept-reject algorithm, importance sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.

If you're a student or a learner interested in Bayesian statistics, you can benefit from these assignments as practical examples. To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and explore the solutions and code for each assignment.

## Assignment 1
The exercises of this assignement regard: the Linear Congruential random number generator and the Inversive Congruential random number generator.

## Assignment 2
The exercises of this assignement regard: estimating a log-odds with a normal prior, genetic linkage model, Poisson regression and variance components model.

## Assignment 3  
The exercises of this assignement regard: approximating posterior distribution for a mixture of exponential data, linear regression model for birthweight and normal hierarchical model with JAGS.

## Assignemet 4
The exercises of this assignement regard: mixture of binomials and mixture of gaussians.
