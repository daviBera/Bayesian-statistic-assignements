# Bayesian-statistic-assignements

This repository contains my solutions for the assignments from the Bayesian Statistics course I completed at the University of Trento. The course covered the foundational concepts of Bayesian statistics, with a particular focus on algorithms and computational techniques.

## Assignment 1
The exercises of this assignement regard random numbers generators. In particular, the Linear Congruential random number generator and the Inversive Congruential Generator.

## Assignment 2
The exercises of this assignement regard: estimating a log-odds with a normal prior, genetic linkage model, Poisson regression and variance components model.

## Assignment 3  
The exercises of this assignement regard: approximating posterior distribution for a mixture of exponential data, linear regression model for birthweight and normal hierarchical model with JAGS.

## Assignemet 4
The exercises of this assignement regard: mixture of binomials and mixture of gaussians.
